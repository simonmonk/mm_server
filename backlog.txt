MM Server Backlog
==================

Rails Cheat sheet
$ rails server
$ bin/rails generate migration AddStateToRetailerAddreses
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails g scaffold Post title:string body:string

New rule for shipments list.

Amazon orders (both) should count as invoiced as long as they are shipped.



Shipment line items for Amazon.com should have extra columns for retail price dollars, extended price in dollars.
This is done, but the total needs to be in dollars too. Also change the Copy Customs Dec field so that it prepends the name.

Javascriptifying
----------------

Working on Shipments
x Tabs for diffent statuses
x Retailer also needs shipping type field caried accross to shipment like the other 2 fields
Add billing email and possibly shipping email to customer and tracking number to shipment.
auto send emails on Despatch (Linda has temnplate)



Stock Report
-------------

From welcome page add a button to generate stock report - also set a crontab to generate this on 31 Dec.

3 sections - Parts, assemblies, products
name, qty, cost (GBP), extended cost
Total


Nice stuff
---------
Parts and view of parts in order-in to show previous prices and who from.


BUGS
----

Parts no longer show what they are used in.

Invoives: Checkbox for VAT should be applied to shipping - Uncompleted and probably needs backing out.




OrderIns, setting price on an order line does not seem to update the price for the part, either when added to the list, or when marked as received.
- Logic should be: set the price and currency when order line added, as long as the price is > 0


Global
======

UI review
----
Dashboard
--
Stock take only done on 31 Dec and needs to show stock at both Amazons

- parts from supplier add cols: code, num in stock, low stock level





Order list of goods
- way to add 0 of everything they sell, or at least be reminded of everything they sell.

Parts list - only show if used in an assembly or product, but check-box to show all.

Assemblies list - only show if used in an active product

Retailers get rid of columns in middle



Check what happens when deduct products for shipments if there aren't enough ditto for parts and assemblies for a product. Introduce transactions.


Nice to have
--

Automatic email when shipment sent.

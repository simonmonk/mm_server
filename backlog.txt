NO!!!! - actually having the console open causes the lock errors, but also, it looked like the anti-click stuff was wrong.

When a Shipment is modified, it changes the invoice date to todays date.

Bookkeeping view 2dp on all currency amounts displayed but 4 dp on exchange rate.

How does hosting work?
- Maybe setup a new micro host with the Wordpress image files copied accross and served by Apache/nginx/Lighttpd etc.


Put a link to a micro:bit getting started guide in the m:b product category section. Ditto Pi.




Changes Needed
===============
Sort parts within a category into alhpabetical order

On the part form would be good to show the login details next to the supplier info at the bottom.

The sort order for purchases seems to be mad after Linda's added a whole load of new transactions in.



Massive Refactoring
--------------------
* Rename out of the way all the Non-view redundant stuff
* Remove all the stuff on:
-- the alerts on the front page.
-- stock level warnings - maybe should just be on products not on parts and assemblies (discuss with Linda)
* Add addresses table
-- we probably need this to do drop-shipping properly





Bookkeeping 
-----------------

Reconciled / checked flag against all items
SO! we don't need this, because reconciliation is about finding things in the bank account that aren't in this list. 
The other way around shouldn't be possible.

So Linda's system for reconciliation is print off the list per account and paper ticks here and paper ticks on every account statement.

Amazon
-
Amazon fees - are a magic number we get the gross amount and can deduce the VAT that needs 
to go on the EU stats collecting thing even though its zero rated. 
For Amazon.com fees are payable in dollars and need to be converted using exchange rate 
- check that Amazon fee adjustment goes in right VAT boxes.

Amazon statements -

Where do wages payments get recorded? Or aren't they because its mostly about VAT ATM. - purchase to indidual

wages
--
Move to the bookeeping view and do as new type, not as purchases


Supporting Docs
--
DONE /public/purchasing_invoices
DONT REALLY NEED SINCE THESE ARE GENERATED FROM DATQA /public/sales_invoices
/public/expense_receipts - MOST USE FROM CAMERA
/public/adjustment_paperwork 

and get gdrived into folders of same name on shared drive





I don't think we need specialised components - because the view from the BookKeeping view will be different - simpler and only concerned with auditability.



New MM Website
--------------

MM server could generate the pages nightly and FTP the files over.



General
--------
Put P.O.s back in.

Add social media fields to customer table:
* instagram account
* following on instagram
* twitter account
* following on twitter

Extra field on Part for duty (VAT in and out doesn't really matter because its neurtal, 
but some things attract import duty and this affects the price of the part.)

Rename text saying 'Retailers' to use 'Customers'


Accounting stuff
=================

Anything that's a Part should set cost centre to MANU automatically

Buy stuff exch rate at purchase date.
Sell stuff ech rate (only Eduporium) should be at pyment date. So add exch rate on reconcile.

- auto go to list items after details form
For VAT report need:
input - goods coming in money going out
output -




Shipments
-----------

Add billing email and possibly shipping email to customer and tracking number to shipment.
auto send emails on Despatch (Linda has temnplate)

Checkbox - show cancelkled orders

Implement follow on orders

Need to be able to edit shipping cost and other fields in Shipment even after its shipped.
- currently solved by being able to unship it.

Sending samples - need to be able to do without assigning invoice number.
- 'special customer'

adding items to list - make default qty 0.
x Packing list - shipping type not appearing in packing list
Need to refresh to get line items not red if they were ever red.



Catalog and Website
--------------------
Add new HTML genberation for:
- List of retailers. To do this will need to add to db: url for customer logo (), cust logo for buy link (70x30), 
          region (Region table)
- Product Pages (Is this time for a new Vue/Bootstrap website)
-- types of pages we have:
welcome - appeal to potential retailers
products list - for retailers
products groups (micro:bit)
product page - information for end users
contact - for potential retailers
-- what we should also have
- help forum for end users. Ask here, reply here, not private emails
- customer portal online P.O.
- Learn pages like Adafruit?

- this looks good - downloaded the app. https://mobirise.com


How to do this.
- How are images handled?
- Where does the verbose product details and getting started material go? Still a job for a CMS when you get to the actual body.
- Is there a nice CMS that uses Node? and maybe produces PDF like AdaFruit




Stock Report
-------------

From welcome page add a button to generate stock report - also set a crontab to generate this on 31 Dec.

3 sections - Parts, assemblies, products
name, qty, cost (GBP), extended cost
Total


Nice stuff
---------
Parts and view of parts in order-in to show previous prices and who from.


Global
======
DB TRANSACTIONS


OrdersIn
---------

Add delivery address to Purchase Order and make formal like the invoice. Both versions. Add MM as supplier and chose default delivery addresses for overide from the list of suppliers.

Need more info about parts - which products/assemblies used in and qty per product/assembly. Info button that makes hovering window to show?



+ Manufacturing Jobs // supports only complete jobs that are 'kitted' and finish
---------------------
+ start date
+ target completion date
+ worker
+ product being made
+ assembly being made
+ quantity total
+ quantity completed
+ quantity collected - but write collection to transaction log
+ hours worked (e.g. Katie / Jackie)
+ piece work price per unit
+ payment type hourly / piece
+ amount earnt for this job
+ amount received for this job

function to check parts/assemblies out of stock
function to check products/assemblies into stock - checkbox for physically collected
function to produce parts / assemblies list


+ Worker
--------
+ name
calc field for amount to pay
function to pay worker



Dashboard
---------

List of outstanding orders.
Overdue payments. invoice date + 
Oustanding VAT invoices - all orders where VAT invoice received == no
Partially complete orders (not all items received)
Catlogs out of date
Calcultae meaningful low stock info based on lead times.

generate VAT report - cost of products sold and shipping and vat due.
 					- think about same for goods bought. // prob not as too complicated to map onto exisitng spreadsheet.


UI review
----
Dashboard
--
Stock take only done on 31 Dec and needs to show stock at both Amazons

- parts from supplier add cols: code, num in stock, low stock level





Order list of goods
- way to add 0 of everything they sell, or at least be reminded of everything they sell.

Parts list - only show if used in an assembly or product, but check-box to show all.

Assemblies list - only show if used in an active product

Retailers get rid of columns in middle



Check what happens when deduct products for shipments if there aren't enough ditto for parts and assemblies for a product. Introduce transactions.


Nice to have
--

Automatic email when shipment sent.

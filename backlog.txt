MM Server Backlog
==================

Rails Cheat sheet
$ rails server
$ bin/rails generate migration AddStateToRetailerAddreses
$ rails generate scaffold Region name:string
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails g scaffold Post title:string body:string

General
--------
Purchases - order suppliers in drop-down. VAT information collected - make a drop-down list.

Add social meadia fields to customer table:
* instagram account
* following on instagram
* twitter account
* following on twitter

Extra field on Part for duty (VAT in and out doesn't really matter because its neurtal, 
but some things attract import duty and this affects the price of the part.)

Rename text saying 'Retailers' to use 'Customers'


Accounting stuff
=================

Anything that's a Part should set cost centre to MANU automatically

Buy stuff exch rate at purchase date.
Sell stuff ech rate (only Eduporium) should be at pyment date. So add exch rate on reconcile.

- auto go to list items after details form
For VAT report need:
input - goods coming in money going out
output -

1. VAT collected from sales
2. VAT that we would have paid if it wasn't zero rated based on 20% only applies to amazon
3. Calculated
4. VAT we have paid and can reclaim + field 2 to balance
5. Calculated
6. Total of things we've sold withithout VAT
7. Things we have bought without vat but some things excluded: [wages, bank charges, PAYE flag on Accounting category - only include things that could attract VAT]
8. Sales to europe without VAT (zero rating only if we have their VAT number)
9. Things bought from EU

EC sales list
country in EU     VAT no      Sales per supplier




BUGS
=====

Check date sorting for shipments

Changes to OrderIn
==================

OrderIn changes.
- account_id - used to pay the invoice
- invoice_uri - of a scan of the invoice, or saved invoice


OrderInLine changes.
- Add a flag - stock_added - so that button Add Stock can be greyed out on an order line.
- category_id - what type of purchase, Materials (Part), stationary, postage, insurance, PAYE etc - get from spreadsheet
This triggers lots of conditional UI.
- cost_centre_id - a single invoice CAN be split accross cost centres

- OrderInLine becomes poymorphic - parts and non-parts, so, it needs extra non-part fields of:
-- name, order code, note



Generating payments CSV
-----------------------


????? Parts probably shouldn't have an exchange rate. Product estimated pricing should prob go off current exchange rate for next order.



New rule for shipments list.
---

Amazon orders (both) should count as invoiced as long as they are shipped.
Shipment line items for Amazon.com should have extra columns for retail price dollars, extended price in dollars.
This is done, but the total needs to be in dollars too. Also change the Copy Customs Dec field so that it prepends the name.
---

Shipments
-----------

Add billing email and possibly shipping email to customer and tracking number to shipment.
auto send emails on Despatch (Linda has temnplate)

Checkbox - show cancelkled orders

Implement follow on orders

Need to be able to edit shipping cost and other fields in Shipment even after its shipped.
- currently solved by being able to unship it.

Sending samples - need to be able to do without assigning invoice number.
- 'special customer'

adding items to list - make default qty 0.
x Packing list - shipping type not appearing in packing list
Need to refresh to get line items not red if they were ever red.



Catalog and Website
--------------------
Add new HTML genberation for:
- List of retailers. To do this will need to add to db: url for customer logo (), cust logo for buy link (70x30), 
          region (Region table)
- Product Pages (Is this time for a new Vue/Bootstrap website)
-- types of pages we have:
welcome - appeal to potential retailers
products list - for retailers
products groups (micro:bit)
product page - information for end users
contact - for potential retailers
-- what we should also have
- help forum for end users. Ask here, reply here, not private emails
- customer portal online P.O.
- Learn pages like Adafruit?

- this looks good - downloaded the app. https://mobirise.com


How to do this.
- How are images handled?
- Where does the verbose product details and getting started material go? Still a job for a CMS when you get to the actual body.
- Is there a nice CMS that uses Node? and maybe produces PDF like AdaFruit




Stock Report
-------------

From welcome page add a button to generate stock report - also set a crontab to generate this on 31 Dec.

3 sections - Parts, assemblies, products
name, qty, cost (GBP), extended cost
Total


Nice stuff
---------
Parts and view of parts in order-in to show previous prices and who from.


BUGS
----

Parts no longer show what they are used in.

Invoives: Checkbox for VAT should be applied to shipping - Uncompleted and probably needs backing out.



Global
======
DB TRANSACTIONS


OrdersIn
---------

Add delivery address to Purchase Order and make formal like the invoice. Both versions. Add MM as supplier and chose default delivery addresses for overide from the list of suppliers.

Need more info about parts - which products/assemblies used in and qty per product/assembly. Info button that makes hovering window to show?

+ quantity completed
+ quantity collected - but write collection to transaction log

function to check parts/assemblies out of stock

+ Worker
--------

calc field for amount to pay
function to pay worker



Dashboard
---------

List of outstanding orders.
Overdue payments. invoice date + 
Oustanding VAT invoices - all orders where VAT invoice received == no
Partially complete orders (not all items received)
Catlogs out of date
Calcultae meaningful low stock info based on lead times.

generate VAT report - cost of products sold and shipping and vat due.
 					- think about same for goods bought. // prob not as too complicated to map onto exisitng spreadsheet.


UI review
----
Dashboard
--
Stock take only done on 31 Dec and needs to show stock at both Amazons

- parts from supplier add cols: code, num in stock, low stock level





Order list of goods
- way to add 0 of everything they sell, or at least be reminded of everything they sell.

Parts list - only show if used in an assembly or product, but check-box to show all.

Assemblies list - only show if used in an active product

Retailers get rid of columns in middle



Check what happens when deduct products for shipments if there aren't enough ditto for parts and assemblies for a product. Introduce transactions.


Nice to have
--

Automatic email when shipment sent.

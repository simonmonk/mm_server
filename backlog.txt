MM Server Backlog
==================

Rails Cheat sheet
$ rails server
$ bin/rails generate migration AddStateToRetailerAddreses
$ rails db:migrate


Shipment line items for Amazon.com should have extra columns for retail price dollars, extended price in dollars.
This is done, but the total needs to be in dollars too. Also change the Copy Customs Dec field so that it prepends the name.

Stock Report
-------------

From welcome page add a button to generate stock report - also set a crontab to generate this on 31 Dec.

3 sections - Parts, assemblies, products
name, qty, cost (GBP), extended cost
Total



BUGS
----

Invoives: Checkbox for VAT should be applied to shipping - Uncompleted and probably needs backing out.

Just a reminder that it would be good if once invoices were issued the prices wouldn't automatically update!
Also, I am confused because invoice 2018070101 shows on the shipment page as $945.50 and the invoice shows $1212.50.
Thanks love :-)



OrderIns, setting price on an order line does not seem to update the price for the part, either when added to the list, or when marked as received.
- Logic should be: set the price and currency when order line added, as long as the price is > 0

UI review

Dashboard
--
Stock take only done on 31 Dec and needs to show stock at both Amazons

- parts from supplier add cols: code, num in stock, low stock level





Order list of goods
- way to add 0 of everything they sell, or at least be reminded of everything they sell.

Parts list - only show if used in an assembly or product, but check-box to show all.

Assemblies list - only show if used in an active product

Retailers get rid of columns in middle



Check what happens when deduct products for shipments if there aren't enough ditto for parts and assemblies for a product. Introduce transactions.


Nice to have

Automatic email when shipment sent.

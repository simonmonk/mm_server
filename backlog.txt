Critical BUGS
==============

When doing update part price from a received order in dollars, the currency seems to get lost. See last order of RGB LEDs for this.

The sort order for purchases seems to be mad after LInda's added a whole load of new transactions in.

x Only enable Invoice uploading once order is saved else no order_number


Deducting stock at shipment seems to be deducting stock twice and then giving error message saying not enough stock in 
the Transaction log.
Can't replicate.



MM Server Backlog
==================

Rails Cheat sheet
$ rails server
$ bin/rails generate migration AddStateToRetailerAddreses
$ rails generate scaffold Region name:string
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails g scaffold Post title:string body:string


Massive Refactoring
--------------------
* Rename out of the way all the Non-view redundant stuff
* Remove all the stuff on:
-- the alerts on the front page.
-- stock level warnings - maybe should just be on products not on parts and assemblies (discuss with Linda)



Bookkeeping 
-----------------

Where do wages payments get recorded? Or aren't they because its mostly about VAT ATM. - purchase to indidual

Supporting Docs
--
DONE /public/purchasing_invoices
DONT REALLY NEED SINCE THESE ARE GENERATED FROM DATQA /public/sales_invoices
/public/expense_receipts - MOST USE FROM CAMERA
/public/adjustment_paperwork 

and get gdrived into folders of same name on shared drive

Adjustment
--
 is a bit crap because it models:
* transfers - from one account to another 
(change to drop-downs and provide migration script to be called from console ]
to find all and link from acc and to acc). Also type (transfer etc) should be from drop-down with switched UI.
* Overpayment / Underpayment - by our customers to use
Statement comes from Amazon and gets split into 3 adjustments:
* Actual Income from Amazon - uk income into current account, US into world first as dollars, EU into world first as euros
 and is sales for period - fees. But some may be held back.
* Reported Income from Amazon - income amount from actual income from Amazon.
* Amazon fees - the fees part from the statement

* HMRC Adjustment - money in or out of current E.g. VAT repayment (because can't do it as a purchase, as you would with a Tax bill)
* Ebay sale - selling off crap (one off etc - prob better just to give away)


Shipment
--
DONE: Needs a account money received into, add to reconcile form.


Expenses
--
View needs usual sorting and filtering options
Add photo capture of expense_receipts




Bookkepeping view
--

Base on VAT page and show icon for uploaded supporting file - allow file association here

DONE - Add a flag to all kinds of bookeeping transaction 'is_checked' - means its finalized and good to go.
DONE - Generate a controller for 'bookkeeping'
DONE - Add a has_proof_uploaded method to order_ins that searches 'public/invoices' dir
Add a has_proof_uploaded to expenses (Camera option)
Add a has_proof_uploaded to adjustments



I don't think we need specialised components - because the view from the BookKeeping view will be different - simpler and only concerned with auditability.



General
--------

Shipping to Amazon - put the code back in to pull over an order. (may just be a button)

There needs to be a way to record failures - E.g. you make 100 RGB LEDs but 10 didn't work. Put on the deduct stock page for assemblies - shouldn't need for parts.




Expenses
--------
* drop-down for time period

New MM Website
--------------
Base on Keystone?
- play with on Mac.
- Move non-autogenerated stuff to blog posts
or
Intercept Wordpress routing and use PHP pages for product pages
or
Use Steve Hall's tunneling so MM Website call pull over a chunk of Javascript 
for the retailer / country drop-downs. Or, actually the whole product page pulled
overnight on a crontab.
MM server could generate the pages nightly and FTP the files over.


Whatever I use, will need to be able to do a post from the 
MM server that sends to the MM website:
- Product details
-- name, desc, pricing, prod url, * links to blog posts, who sells (by country)
- Customer details
-- name, website, 


General
--------
Put P.O.s back in.

Add social meadia fields to customer table:
* instagram account
* following on instagram
* twitter account
* following on twitter

Extra field on Part for duty (VAT in and out doesn't really matter because its neurtal, 
but some things attract import duty and this affects the price of the part.)

Rename text saying 'Retailers' to use 'Customers'


Accounting stuff
=================

Anything that's a Part should set cost centre to MANU automatically

Buy stuff exch rate at purchase date.
Sell stuff ech rate (only Eduporium) should be at pyment date. So add exch rate on reconcile.

- auto go to list items after details form
For VAT report need:
input - goods coming in money going out
output -




BUGS
=====


Changes to OrderIn
==================

OrderIn changes.
- account_id - used to pay the invoice
- invoice_uri - of a scan of the invoice, or saved invoice


OrderInLine changes.
- Add a flag - stock_added - so that button Add Stock can be greyed out on an order line.
- category_id - what type of purchase, Materials (Part), stationary, postage, insurance, PAYE etc - get from spreadsheet
This triggers lots of conditional UI.
- cost_centre_id - a single invoice CAN be split accross cost centres

- OrderInLine becomes poymorphic - parts and non-parts, so, it needs extra non-part fields of:
-- name, order code, note



Generating payments CSV
-----------------------


????? Parts probably shouldn't have an exchange rate. Product estimated pricing should prob go off current exchange rate for next order.



New rule for shipments list.
---

Amazon orders (both) should count as invoiced as long as they are shipped.
Shipment line items for Amazon.com should have extra columns for retail price dollars, extended price in dollars.
This is done, but the total needs to be in dollars too. Also change the Copy Customs Dec field so that it prepends the name.
---

Shipments
-----------

Add billing email and possibly shipping email to customer and tracking number to shipment.
auto send emails on Despatch (Linda has temnplate)

Checkbox - show cancelkled orders

Implement follow on orders

Need to be able to edit shipping cost and other fields in Shipment even after its shipped.
- currently solved by being able to unship it.

Sending samples - need to be able to do without assigning invoice number.
- 'special customer'

adding items to list - make default qty 0.
x Packing list - shipping type not appearing in packing list
Need to refresh to get line items not red if they were ever red.



Catalog and Website
--------------------
Add new HTML genberation for:
- List of retailers. To do this will need to add to db: url for customer logo (), cust logo for buy link (70x30), 
          region (Region table)
- Product Pages (Is this time for a new Vue/Bootstrap website)
-- types of pages we have:
welcome - appeal to potential retailers
products list - for retailers
products groups (micro:bit)
product page - information for end users
contact - for potential retailers
-- what we should also have
- help forum for end users. Ask here, reply here, not private emails
- customer portal online P.O.
- Learn pages like Adafruit?

- this looks good - downloaded the app. https://mobirise.com


How to do this.
- How are images handled?
- Where does the verbose product details and getting started material go? Still a job for a CMS when you get to the actual body.
- Is there a nice CMS that uses Node? and maybe produces PDF like AdaFruit




Stock Report
-------------

From welcome page add a button to generate stock report - also set a crontab to generate this on 31 Dec.

3 sections - Parts, assemblies, products
name, qty, cost (GBP), extended cost
Total


Nice stuff
---------
Parts and view of parts in order-in to show previous prices and who from.


BUGS
----

Parts no longer show what they are used in.

Invoives: Checkbox for VAT should be applied to shipping - Uncompleted and probably needs backing out.



Global
======
DB TRANSACTIONS


OrdersIn
---------

Add delivery address to Purchase Order and make formal like the invoice. Both versions. Add MM as supplier and chose default delivery addresses for overide from the list of suppliers.

Need more info about parts - which products/assemblies used in and qty per product/assembly. Info button that makes hovering window to show?



+ Manufacturing Jobs // supports only complete jobs that are 'kitted' and finish
---------------------

+ piece work price per unit
+ payment type hourly / piece
+ amount earnt for this job
+ amount received for this job

function to check parts/assemblies out of stock
function to check products/assemblies into stock - checkbox for physically collected
function to produce parts / assemblies list


+ Worker
--------
+ name
calc field for amount to pay
function to pay worker



Dashboard
---------

List of outstanding orders.
Overdue payments. invoice date + 
Oustanding VAT invoices - all orders where VAT invoice received == no
Partially complete orders (not all items received)
Catlogs out of date
Calcultae meaningful low stock info based on lead times.

generate VAT report - cost of products sold and shipping and vat due.
 					- think about same for goods bought. // prob not as too complicated to map onto exisitng spreadsheet.


UI review
----
Dashboard
--
Stock take only done on 31 Dec and needs to show stock at both Amazons

- parts from supplier add cols: code, num in stock, low stock level





Order list of goods
- way to add 0 of everything they sell, or at least be reminded of everything they sell.

Parts list - only show if used in an assembly or product, but check-box to show all.

Assemblies list - only show if used in an active product

Retailers get rid of columns in middle



Check what happens when deduct products for shipments if there aren't enough ditto for parts and assemblies for a product. Introduce transactions.


Nice to have
--

Automatic email when shipment sent.

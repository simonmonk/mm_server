MM Server Backlog
==================

Rails Cheat sheet
$ rails server
$ bin/rails generate migration AddStateToRetailerAddreses
$ rails db:migrate


Shipment line items for Amazon.com should have extra columns for retail price dollars, extended price in dollars.
This is done, but the total needs to be in dollars too. Also change the Copy Customs Dec field so that it prepends the name.
---


BUGS
----

In the shipments list the value of the shipment is shown with the amount converted to GBP - this should be original amount, not converted amount.

OrderIns, setting price on an order line does not seem to update the price for the part, either when added to the list, or when marked as received.
- Logic should be: set the price and currency when order line added, as long as the price is > 0

UI review

Dashboard

Stock take only done on 31 Dec and needs to show stock at both Amazons

- parts from supplier add cols: code, num in stock, low stock level





Order list of goods
- way to add 0 of everything they sell, or at least be reminded of everything they sell.

Parts list - only show if used in an assembly or product, but check-box to show all.

Assemblies list - only show if used in an active product

Retailers get rid of columns in middle



Check what happens when deduct products for shipments if there aren't enough ditto for parts and assemblies for a product. Introduce transactions.
